# PetPal

### **Happy pet, happy life - Keep your pal thriving with our app!**

## **Inspiration**
PetPal was created to help future pet owners better understand the maintenance required to keep their pets happy. We recognize the challenges and stress new pet owners face when they don't understand their pets' signs and behaviors. Our goal is to address this issue by providing a comprehensive and user-friendly app.

## **What It Does**
PetPal consolidates essential information that pet owners typically need to search for online. Users can select an animal they wish to have as a pet, which directs them to different tabs covering the pet's basic information, diet, habitat requirements, and health concerns.

## **How We Built It**
We developed PetPal using Swift and designed the user interface with Xcode's Interface Builder, utilizing Storyboard files for layout.

## **Challenges We Ran Into**
As Swift was new to us, we encountered numerous trials and errors while creating PetPal. This limited some of the capabilities we could implement, but we persevered to deliver a functional and informative app.

## **Accomplishments That We're Proud Of**
We are proud of our effective design that creates a warm and inviting experience for users. The simple yet clean design aligns with our goal of providing crucial information to future pet owners and preventing animal mistreatment due to misinformation.

## **What We Learned**
Through this project, we learned the importance of creating apps that streamline processes for users, making their lives more comfortable and convenient. Our experience with Swift and app design has been invaluable.

## **What's Next for PetPal**
In the future, we aim to enhance PetPal by adding features such as setting appointments with local veterinarians, finding places to adopt or buy pets, and improving the accuracy and breadth of our information to offer the best guidance in pet care.

## **Built With**
- Swift
- Xcode's Interface Builder

## **App Interface Overview**
PetPal's interface is designed with several key sections to provide information and support for pet owners:

- **Health Tab:** Displays common health issues and symptoms to look out for in pets.
- **Diet and Habitat Tab:** Provides information on the appropriate diet and habitat requirements for the selected pet.
- **About Tab:** General information about the pet, including care tips and personality traits.

## **Storyboard Description**
The user interface is defined in a storyboard file, structured as follows:

- **Health Scene:** Contains labels and images to describe common health issues and symptoms.
- **Diet and Habitat Scene:** Contains labels and images to describe the diet and habitat needs of the pet.
- **About Scene:** Contains labels and images to provide general information about the pet.

## **Key Components**
